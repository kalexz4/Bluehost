### 1.   Description
#### A data encryption program that can encrypt your selected files / folders with a password. Created by one person, kalex. Actively updating and improving this program. Currently you cannot contact me for questions. What is a data encrypter? Data encryption translates data into another form, or code, so that only people with access to a secret key (formally called a decryption key) or password can read it. Encrypted data is commonly referred to as ciphertext, while unencrypted data is called plaintext. Currently, encryption is one of the most popular and effective data security methods used by organizations. Two main types of data encryption exist - asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, and symmetric encryption.
